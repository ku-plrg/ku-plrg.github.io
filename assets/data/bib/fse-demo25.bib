  abstract = {ECMA-262 is the official language specification for JavaScript that defines the language semantics in detail. However, readers often struggle to understand the specification due to the intricate edge cases and lengthy, highly nested explanations. To address this issue, we present JSSpecVis, an interactive web interface visualizing the JavaScript language specification. For an intuitive understanding of edge cases, it provides example programs for each part of the specification with a call-path context selected by readers. In addition, it supports the interactive execution of JavaScript programs on the specification with a new debugging feature called resume and provenance for advanced debugging of JavaScript programs. Using these functionalities, JSSpecVis provides an intuitive learning environment for beginners and a powerful productivity for experts. Our tool is open at https://github.com/ku-plrg/js-spec-vis, and the tool demonstration is available at https://youtu.be/xqLPmVVlORQ.},
