### Installation of Scala and sbt

[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) is a general-purpose programming language
combining **object-oriented** and **functional** programming in one concise,
high-level language. Scala's **static types** help avoid bugs in complex
applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance
systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.

The interactive **build tool** [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) is built for
Scala and Java projects.

Please download and install them using the following links:
- JDK >= 8 [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Scala - [https://www.scala-lang.org/download/](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
- sbt - [https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
